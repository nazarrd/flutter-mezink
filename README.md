# Mezink Flutter Hiring Challenge

A Flutter web page that displays a table of users fetched from the [test API](https://reqres.in/).

## Specifications

1. API: [https://reqres.in/](https://reqres.in/)
2. State Management: [Provider](https://pub.dev/packages/provider)
3. HTTP Requests: [Dio](https://pub.dev/packages/dio)

## Feature

This web is hosted using Firebase hosting. [Click here to see demo](https://test-a6b03.web.app/).

1. Pagination: Implement pagination for the user data. The table should not load all
the users at once but should provide an option to navigate through pages.
2. Search: Include a basic search bar to search through user names or any relevant
user data.
3. Filter: Implement a basic filter mechanism to filter out users based on specific
criteria (e.g., based on user role, location, etc.).
4. Sorting: Users should be able to click on table column headers to sort the data in
ascending or descending order based on that particular column.
